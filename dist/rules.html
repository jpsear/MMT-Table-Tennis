      <h1>Rules</h1>

      <ul class=rules-list>
        <li>First to 21 points, but you must win by 2 clear points</li>
        <li>Decide who serves first by a short rally before the game, or spin a bat</li>
        <li>Change serve every 5 points</li>
        <li>The serve must bounce once on either side of the court</li>
        <li>If the bat hits the table on the serve, a point is awarded to the opponent</li>
        <li>If the serve touches the net and goes in, a let is called and the serve is taken again</li>
        <li>There is no limit on the amount of lets</li>
        <li>Subsequent points must bounce once in the opponent's half</li>
        <li>If it touches the table, it's in — no matter how thin the touch may be</li>
